The HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Module has 4 pins, Ground,
vcC, Trig and Echo. The Ground and the VCC
pins of the module needs to be connected to the
Ground and the 5 volts pins on the Arduino Board
respectively and the trig and echo pins to any Digital
/0 pin on the Arduino Board.

The HC-SR04 sensor attach to the Breadboard
The Sensor VCC connect to the Arduino Board+5V
The Sensor GND connect to the Arduino Board GND
The Sensor Trig connect to the Arduino Board Digital
